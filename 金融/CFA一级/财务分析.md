# Financial Reporting and Analysis
## 原理前导：财务上的“三个代表”
- 资产负债表代表企业的资产、负债和所有者权益，体现其整体实力
- 利润表代表企业的利润来源，体现其盈利能力
- 现金流量表代表企业的现金流量，体现其获现能力

> 资产负债表是静态指标，反映企业某个时点的财务状况；利润表是动态指标，反映企业某段时期的经营成果，资产负债表未分配利润期末数等于利润表净利润本年累计数加上年初未分配利润数。资产负债表货币资金期末数减期初数，等于现金流量表现金净增加值。

## The Framework of FRS
### The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) 一般通用的会计准则
> The Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)  U.S.GAAP

### The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 国际通用会计准则
> The International Accounting Standards (IAS)
> The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)

### Framework
1. The role of financial reporting and financial statement analysis
2. The resources used for financial statement analysis
   - Key financial statements
   - Other relevant information
3. Auditing
4. Financial statement analysis framework




- treasury stock 库存股
1、所有者权益抵减,股票数量减少
2、回收回来的库存股没有投票权，没有分红

### treasury stock method
##### Diluted EPS
> If the options or warrants are dilutive, use the treasury stock method to calculate the number of shares used in the denominator.
> 如果期权或者权证被稀释，可以使用库存股计量方法来计算EPS公式分母上的股票数量

> The treasury stock method assumes that the funds received by the company from the exercise of the options would be used to hypothetically purchase shares of the company's common stock in the market at the average market price.
> 库存股计量方法推测可以按照普通股平均的市场价格来回购

#### P96
- Example: Treasury stock method

- simple EPS
$$EPS = \frac{NI}{the \space number \space of \space stock}$$

```
Baxter Company has 5,000 shares outstanding all year. Baxter had 2,000 outstanding warrants all year, convertible into one share each at $20 per share. The year-end price of Baxter stock was $40, and the average stock price was $30. What effect will these warrants have on the weighted average number of shares?
Baxter公司有5000股在外发行的股票，有2000在外流通的权证。一股权证对应一股股票，在$20的时候，在年终的时候股票价格为$40，股票的平均价格为$30。权证转换为股票用的是平均价格做的假设。考虑权证转换为股票对股票数量的影响

Answer:
1、If the warrants are exercised, the company will receive 2,000 × $20 = $40,000 and issue 2,000 new shares.
要行权的话，需要按照$20买入价格，需要花费$40000买入2000股股票
   1° 净收益增加 $40000
   2° 股票数增加 2000
   3° 需要抵消$40000净利润增加值带来的影响，因为无法评估投资、经营情况对净利润的影响
   4° 则拿着$40000回购股票，减少影响，但这并不是一定的
2、The treasury stock method assumes the company uses these funds to repurchase shares at the average market price of $30.
按照$30进行回购
3、The company would repurchase $40,000 / $30 = 1,333 shares.
按照$30回购的股票数
4、Net shares issued would be 2,000 - 1,333 = 667 shares.
实际上新增加667股股票
```
#### P97
- Example 6
```
EPS with Warrants/ Stock options
GF has 5000 shares outstanding all year. GF had 2000 outstanding warrants all year, convertible into one share each at $20 per share. The year-end price of GF stock was $40, and the average stock price was $30. If GF had net income of $10,000 of the year, what is GF basic and diluted EPS?
GF公司在外发行的股票数为5000，有2000的权证，在股票价格为$20的时候行权，年底的时候GF的价格为$40，一年股票的平均价格为$30，假如GF在年底的时候有净利润$10000，那GF公司的EPS和DEPS是多少

Answer：
BEPS = $10,000/5,000 = $2.00
Adjusted income available for common shares = $10,000
Weighted average common shares and potential shares = 5,000 + 667 = 5,667
DEPS = $10,000 / 5,667 = $1.76

Shares outstanding                     5,000
Warrants conversion                    2,000
Treasury shares purchased             (1,333)
Denominator                            5,667
```

### Comprehensive income
#### P98
##### Retained earnings
> At the end of each accounting period, the net income of the firm is added to stockholders' equity through an account known as retained earnings.

> Therefore, any transaction that affects the income statement (net income) will also affect stockholders' equity.

#### P100
##### Comprehensive income CI
> CI = NI + OCI , OCI直接影响equity
> Comprehensive income is a more inclusive measure that includes all changes in equity except for owner contributions and distributions. That is, comprehensive income is the sum of net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income includes transactions that are not included in net income.

> Other comprehensive Income for both GAAP and IFRS
> 1.Foreign currency **translation** gains and losses
> 2.Certain costs of a company’s **defined benefit** post-retirement plans that are not recognized in the current period.(actuarial gains/losses)
> 3.**Unrealized** gains and losses from cash flow hedging derivatives.
> 4.**Unrealized** gains and losses from available-for-sale securities

> Under IFRS, other comprehensive income includes certain changes in the value of long-lived assets that are measured using the revaluation model rather than the cost model

### Balance Sheet format and components
#### P103
##### Assets
> Provide probable future economic benefits controlled by an entity as a result of previous transactions

> Current and Non – current assets (Long – lived assets)

##### Liabilities
> Are obligations owed by an entity from previous transactions that are expected to result in an outflow of economic benefits in the future.

> Current and Non – current liabilities (Long – term liabilities)

##### Stockholders’ equity
> Is the residual interest in assets that remains after subtracting a firm’s liabilities.

> A financial statement item should be recognized if a future economic benefit from the item (flowing to or from the firm) is probable and the item's value or cost can be measured reliably.

### Balance Sheet - Limitations
#### P104
##### Uses and limitations of the balance sheet in financial analysis
> The balance sheet can be used to assess a firm's liquidity, solvency, and ability to make distributions to shareholders.
> From the firm's perspective, liquidity is the ability to meet short-term obligations
> Solvency is the ability to meet long-term obligations

### Alternative formats of balance sheet presentation
#### P105
##### Classified balance sheet 有小计分类的资产负债表

> Both IFRS and U.S. GAAP require firms to separately report their current assets and noncurrent assets and current and noncurrent liabilities.

> The current/noncurrent format is known as a classified balance sheet and is useful in evaluating liquidity.

##### Liquidity-based presentations 根据流动性的列示
> Under IFRS, firms can choose to use a liquidity-based format if the presentation is more relevant and reliable.

> Liquidity-based presentations, which are often used in the banking industry, present assets and liabilities in the order of liquidity.

- Example 2
```
For financial assets classified as trading securities, how are unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders’ equity?
A. They are not recognized
B. As an adjustment to paid-in capital
C. They flow through income into retained earnings

Answer:
For financial assets classified as trading securities, unrealized gains and losses are reported on the income statement and flow to shareholders’ equity as part of retained earnings.
```

- Example 3
```
For financial assets classified as available for sale, how are unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders’ equity?
A. They are not recognized
B. They flow through retained earnings
C. As a separate line item (other comprehensive income)

Answer:
For financial assets classified as available for sale, unrealized gains and losses are not recorded on the income statement but do appear on the balance sheet. Shareholders’ equity is adjusted through a separate line item for valuation gains and losses termed “other comprehensive income.”

### The cash flow statement
#### P114
> The cash flow statement provides information beyond that available from the income statement, which is based on accrual, rather than cash, accounting. The cash low statement provides the following:
